**Privacy-Preserving Neural Network**

**Overview**

This repository is a re-implementation of the paper "__A privacy-preserving protocol for neural-network-based computation__" ,
https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1161366.1161393

discusses the problem of securely processing data using neural networks (specifically, single-layer perceptrons).
The neural network processes sensitive data provided by a client (such as financial data),
without revealing any information about the input data or the internal structure of the neural network.
